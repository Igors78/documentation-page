                <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
                    
                    There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and 
                    so on.
                    This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself. 
                    But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is 
                    a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that 
                    you don’t spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js). 
                    We’ll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the next part of the tutorial. So first, let’s see how 
                    we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script 
                    with a command like "node my.js".
                    Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: 
                    Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
                    The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and
                    run automatically as the page loads.
                    Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation
                    to run.
                    In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

                <p>Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory
                    or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
                    JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js
                    supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, 
                    etc.
                    In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, 
                    and the webserver.

                    with a command like "node my.js".
                    As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files. 
                    The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.
                    Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading 
                    it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.
                    That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.
                    There is much more to learn about browser scripts and their interaction with the webpage. 
                    But let’s keep in mind that this part of the tutorial is devoted to the JavaScript language, so we shouldn’t 
                    distract ourselves with browser-specific implementations of it. We’ll be

                <header>Code structure</header>
                <p>The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code.

                    Statements
                    Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
                    
                    We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
                    
                    We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.
                    
                    For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:
                    
                    alert('Hello'); alert('World');
                    Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:
                    
                    alert('Hello');
                    alert('World');</p>
                <p>This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself. 
                    But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is 
                    a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that 
                    you don’t spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js). 
                    We’ll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the next part of the tutorial. So first, let’s see how 
                    we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script 
                    with a command like "node my.js".A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.

                    This would also work:
                    
                    alert('Hello')
                    alert('World')
                    Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an 
                    automatic semicolon insertion.
                    
                    In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!
                    
                    There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:
                    
                    alert(3 +
                    1
                    + 2);
                    The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious 
                    that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete expression”, so the semicolon is not required. And in this case that works as intended.
                    
                    But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.
                    
                    Errors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself. 
                    But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is 
                    a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that

                <code>As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which 
                    describe what the code does and why.

                    Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine 
                    simply ignores them.
                    
                    One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.
                    
                    The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.
                    
                    Like here:
                    
                    // This comment occupies a line of its own

                <p>Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

                    An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
                    A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.
                    Variables are used to store this information.
                    
                    A variable
                    A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
                    
                    To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.
                    
                    The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:
                    
                    let message;
                    Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:
                    
                    let message;
                    
                    message = 'Hello'; // store the string
                    The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the 
                    variable name:
                    
                    let message;
                    message = 'Hello!';
                    
                    alert(message); // shows the variable contentThis part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself. 
                    But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is 
                    a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that 
                    you don’t spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js). 
                    We’ll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the next part of the tutorial. So first, let’s see how 
                    we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script 
                    with a command like "node my.js".</p>
                <p>To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:

                    let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value
                    
                    alert(message); // Hello!
                    We can also declare multiple variables in one line:
                    
                    let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
                    That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single 
                    line per variable.
                    
                    The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:
                    
                    let user = 'John';
                    let age = 25;
                    let message = 'Hello';This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.

                    a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that

                <code>Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:

                    let user = 'John',
                    age = 25,
                    message = 'Hello';
                    …Or even in the “comma-first” style:
                    
                    let user = 'John'
                    , age = 25
                    , message = 'Hello';
                    Technically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it’s a matter of personal taste and aesthetics.

                <header>Data types</header>
                <p>A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.

                    There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we’ll cover them in general and in the next chapters 
                    we’ll talk about each of them in detail.
                    
                    We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a 
                    number:
                    This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself. 
                    But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is

                    we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script 
                    with a command like "node my.js".
                    // no error
                    let message = "hello";
                    message = 123456;
                    Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning 
                    that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.
                    
                    Number
                    let n = 123;
                    n = 12.345;
                    The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
                    
                    There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and 
                    so on.
                    This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself. 
                    But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is 
                    a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so that 
                    you don’t spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js). 
                    We’ll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the next part of the tutorial. So first, let’s see how 
                    we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script 
                    with a command like "node my.js".
                    Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: 
                    Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
                    
                    Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.
                    
                    We can get it as a result of division by zero:
                    
                    alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity
                    Or just reference it directly:
                    
                    alert( Infinity ); // Infinity
                    NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, 
                    for instance:
                    
                    alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous
                    NaN is sticky. Any further operation on NaN returns NaN:
                    
                    alert( "not a number" / 2 + 5 ); // NaN
                    So, if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result.
                </p>
                <p>Mathematical operations are safe
                    Doing maths is “safe” in JavaScript. We can do anything: divide by zero, treat non-numeric strings 
                    as numbers, etc.
                    
                    The script will never stop with a fatal error (“die”). At worst, we’ll get NaN as the result.
                    
                    Special numeric values formally belong to the “number” type. Of course they are not numbers in the common 
                    sense of this word.
                    
                    We’ll see more about working with numbers in the chapter Numbers.
                    
                    BigInt
                    In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), 
                    or less than -(253-1) for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.
                    
                    For most purposes that’s quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or 
                    microsecond-precision timestamps.
                    
                    BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.
                    
                    A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:
                    
                    // the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
                    const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
                    As BigInt numbers are rarely needed, we don’t cover them here, but devoted them a separate chapter BigInt. 
                    Read it when you need such big numbers.
                </p>
                <code>String
                    A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
                    
                    let str = "Hello";
                    let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
                    let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
                    In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
                    
                    Double quotes: "Hello".
                    Single quotes: 'Hello'.
                    Backticks: `Hello`.
                    Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.
                    
                    Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a 
                    string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:
                    
                    let name = "John";
                    
                    // embed a variable
                    alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!
                    
                    // embed an expression
                    alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3
                    The expression inside ${…} is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string. We can put anything 
                    in there: a variable like name or an arithmetical expression like 1 + 2 or something more complex.
                    
                    Please note that this can only be done in backticks. Other quotes don’t have this embedding functionality!
